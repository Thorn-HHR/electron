So far, the new features are:
- the driver can select a "public session" option which will list the session on
  the main page for anyone to join along with the numbers of riders currently in
  that session.
- the driver can select a "blindfold riders" option which will hide the controls
  on all riders' screens, only showing them the graphics and traffic lights
- if the driver disconnects, the riders are notified and given a driving url to
  find a new driver.  The next person who opens that url becomes the new driver
  of the existing session.
- the driver can set a "nametag" that shows up for the riders, so they know
  who's driving.  If a nametag is set on a public session, it shows the driver's
  name on the listing instead of the random ID.
- the driver can set comments/notes for the session to describe what sort of
  session it is, if they'll be using pain tools, etc.  This will be displayed to
  riders.
- the driver can save a script of the session, which is a json file that can
  then be replayed in another session.  The session script will include any use
  of pain tools.  The driver name and session comments, if set, will also be
  added to any saved session script.  
- when a driver plays a script file, it will tell the riders that a script is
  being played, the name of the file, and the driver name from that file.
- the driver can set a URL where they're hosting cammers for the ride.  The URL
  will be shared to all riders.
- bottle prompting.  Driver can select from 1-10 seconds and the riders will get
  a full screen popup with a picture of a brown bottle and a countdown.  bottle
  prompts will be saved to session files and played back.


Still pending:
- A clear session history button, so if you've been playing a file but don't
  want it to be part of the session when you save later, you can start fresh.
  Not totally sure about this one or the form it should take yet.
